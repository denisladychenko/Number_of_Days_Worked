# Number_of_Days_Worked
Converts number of hours  into number of days worked

Design a class called NumDays. The class's purpose is to store a value that represents a number of work hours and convert it to a number of days. For example, 8 hours would be converted to 1 day, 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days, and 18 hours would be converted to 2.25 days. The class should have a constructor that accepts a number of hours, as well as member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days. The class should also have the following overloaded operators:

1. The addition operator +. The number of hours in the sum of two objects is the sum of the number of hours in the individual objects.
2. The subtraction operator -. The number of hours in the difference of two objects X and Y is the number of hours in X minus the number of hours in Y.
3. Prefix and postfix increment operators ++. The number of hours in an object is incremented by 1.
4. Prefix and postfix decrement operators --. The number of hours in an object is decremented by 1.
